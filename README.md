# FaderBar

A tiny app to automate a system volume fade out. Example uses:

- falling asleep to some music or a podcast
- tactfully ending a party
- winding up computer novices

## Usage

1. Start app
2. Hit `Start`
3. Volume will fade out (you can check the remaining time in the menu)

To cancel you can click `Stop` and the volume will be reset to the original value.

## Preferences

Set the time using the slider or override with the text field.

If `Go to sleep after fade` is selected your mac will hit the hay as soon as the fade ends.
